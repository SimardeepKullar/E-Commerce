        As a software engineering student there are 2 things that I took pride in; 
        Programming and Shoes. Me and my team are announcing our newest venture Sneaker 
        Studio. From group of guys that looked homeless from ankle up going to each lecture, 
        we share our passion of programming and shoes to bring you an application that 
        allows students like us to buy their dream sneakers from comfort of their dorm room.

    <p>
        Growing up I worked multiple jobs just so I can have the newest kicks' in the 
        school, and work overtime to ensure I had the correct supplies to clean it. 
        Carrying that passion through out my life, I am proud to announce that passion 
        has turned into business. I am here with my team to allow kids to go far and beyond 
        with their dream sneakers, because it is not about what shoe you wear, it's about
        where you go with those shoes.
